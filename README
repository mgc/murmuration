Murmuration is a prototype add-on for the Songbird media player.
In conjunction with a server project on http://skunk.grommit.com
Murmuration shares everything you do in Songbird
with your subscribers.  

The idea is to passively monitor what you friends are doing, and
sample music directly from their libraries.
